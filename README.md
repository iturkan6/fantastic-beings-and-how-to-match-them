# Fantastic Beings and How to Match Them
Work on project. Stage 1/7:Your magic universe
----------------------------------------------

Description
-----------

Match-three is a game where players need to align combinations of three identical elements. Combinations include swapping elements of the adjacent cells on the playing field. Once the right combination aligns, it disappears, and new random elements are displayed in its place. The game continues until the required number of elements disappears.

At this stage, you need to create a playing field for your future game using HTML and CSS.

Put a status bar with the state of the game on the field; it will display the number of moves, creatures, and other game stats. Also, don't forget to include a map with cells where creatures will appear as the game progresses.
